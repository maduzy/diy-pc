# diy-pc
AS3 implementation of the Amazon's associates program

The core concept of this project is to allow someone to build a PC without previous knowledge on the matter.
Through this app, you can define a budget for your computer, give it a purpose (gaming or web browsing for examples) and it automatically searches on Amazon for the parts you need, providing links to purchase them.
I try to allocate a higher value of the budget to parts where the selected purpose calls for - for instance, if you choose Gaming, a higher value of the budget will be assigned to the graphics card.
There's also a YouTube embed video tutorial showing you how to build a PC and you can navigate on the timeline of the video to watch how parts are assembled (motherboard, CPU, RAM assembly [...]).
The app is an academic example I made in university and never had a commercial goal.

DIY-PC is a non functioning example as my Amazon affiliate account has been suspended due to inactivity.
I also decided not to share the PHP client this application connects to, which itself connects to the Amazon's affiliates API, as it contains sensitive information. I included a sample.xml file that shows an example of what the PHP client would output.

The code is free to use without restrictions.
